This is a statistical physics model of the spread of infection within a population of people based on three parameters and three different states. The population cycle through the states based on the statistical chance they surroundings and a statistical uncertainty modelled through monte carlo simulation
S - susceptible
I - infected
R - recovered
S - susceptible again
